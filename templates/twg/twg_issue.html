<p>We noticed that you recently acquired TWG stocks through follow on offer or DRS transaction, and we saw some customers sold at low price, then bought back at much higher price, which could cause regulatory attention to your trading activities.&nbsp;TWG had very high price fluctuation on last Friday which causes us big concern. <strong>Therefore, we have to restrict you from purchasing more TWG shares on public market on 30 days.</strong></p>
